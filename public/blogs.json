        "q": "When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?",
        "ans": "NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. On the other hand, MongoDB is a NoSQL Database which is document oriented. If we need persistent data availability than we need to use a database such as mongodb. To get connected with the database we need a javascript runtime environment like nodejs. NodeJS enables the client side sever to connect to a outside server."
