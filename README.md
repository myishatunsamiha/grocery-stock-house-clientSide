#### What I have done in this project: 
* Main routes of the project: home, blogs, login, register, stock display and update, manage items, add items and my items. 

* On the home page, there are six sections. Navbar, banner(expressing the moto), inventories, main features of the websites, newsletter subscription and footer. 

* Each inventory has information like id, name, img, description, price, quantity, category, supplier and sold. On the home page, we will be able to see maximum 6 items from the inventory and a manage inventory button will be there to redirect us to a page(Manage Inventory) where we can see all the inventory items. 

* On the manage inventory page, we will see all the inventory items' name, img, quantity and a corresponding delete button for each item. here, an authorized user can delete any item also can add new items by clicking the add items button.

* Add items button will bring you to a page where an authorized user will be able to add new products along with their email address. 

* On the my items page, the authorized user will be able to see the items which he/she has added and he/she can delete those item if they wish to do so. 

* On the inventory item page(dynamic page for each item), the authorized user will be able to add any quantity to a product or he/she can reduce the item by one by clicking delivered button.

* On the blogs page, you can see three frequently asked questions have been answered.

* Firebase email-password authentication along with google firebase login have been implemented.
